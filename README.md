**Warning:** Copying and pasting code from this cheat sheet for a programming competition will cause you to fail the plagiarism detector.

This cheat sheet contains concise implementations of common data structures and algorithms (DS&As) in Python. Its purpose is to give you a short list of DS&As that are worth memorizing because they are frequently used, yet most people struggle with them. I have excluded DS&As that most computer science graduates can implement with very little thought, such as tree traversals.
